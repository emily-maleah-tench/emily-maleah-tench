Artist is one of the many hats that I wear, along with musician, writer, lover, fighter, and so much more through the variety of life.

Art is a word that moves into line with my intended meaning in the plural: ‘arts’. I draw inspiration from artists of long ago, artists of today, and my secret heroes – imagining their contexts, bound by my own experiences, bringing this to bear as praxis in my life and in the art that I make.
